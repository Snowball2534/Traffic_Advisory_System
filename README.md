### Traffic_Advisory_System 
  
The project implements a traffic_advisory_system with five functions:  
1. Introduction to Travelling City.  
2. Display the Time Graph.  
3. Display the Cost Graph.  
4. Generate the Shortest Path by Time.  
5. Generate the Shortest Path by Cost.  

The project mainly uses the data structure of graph and Dijkstra's algorithm.  
Also, the project includes five JUnit5 tests.  
  
All the program compilation and running work has been integrated into makefile. You can directly run this file to test the project.
